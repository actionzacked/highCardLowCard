## Decription
Played with a deck of cards numbered 1 through 9. The dealer shuffles the deck and then draws a random card. The player then guesses if the next card drawn will be HIGHER or LOWER than the first card.  

The dealer then draws a second card from the deck, revealing if the player won or lost.

## To Play

1. A prompt appears asking the player to guess if the next card will be higher or lower than the card drawn by the computer. The player then enters `h` or `l` and presses `RETURN` to give their choice.
1. Repeat 5 times and see who wins!

* Initial release. My fiance was playing Animal Crossings: New Horizon and one of the characters played this game. I thought it would be fun to code it for no reason at all. Hope you enjoy!

* Added a fun little title screen too :)
